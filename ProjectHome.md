The Virtual Display Color Processor (VDCP) is a hardware tool for monitoring the pixel data sent from the computer to the display via the Digital Video Interface (DVI) cable. The VDCP is a circuit board to be connected between the DVI cable and the DVI port. The VDCP circuit retrieves the red, green, and blue subpixel values of the target pixel and then shows the subpixel values on the display. The hardware portion of VDCP consists of a field programmable gate array (FPGA) board (Cyclone III QB3, Altera) and a DVI daughter board (DVI-HSMC, Terasic). The software portion of VDCP, as described in this document, was designed with the Verilog hardware description language.
